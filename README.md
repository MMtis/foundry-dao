# Foundry DAO Governance

This is a section of the Cyfrin FoundryÂ Solidity Course.

_Please note: ERC20 based voting is not always recommended, and I encourage you to explore other forms of governance like reputation based or "skin-in-the-game" based._

[One of my favorite articles on money-based voting being bad](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html)

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-dao
cd foundry-dao
forge install
forge build
```

# Usage

## Test

```
forge test
```

## Deploy

I did not write deploy scripts for this project, you can if you'd like!

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see and output file called `.gas-snapshot`

# Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```
